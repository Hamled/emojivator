<p>Q3: I just got word from the Chief Scientist for the entire Emojivator project -- she's taken a keen interest in this particular machine. She'd like to know if you can get the machine to produce an output that does not include ANY emojis used as input for the first Emojivator (that is, produce an output including ONLY these emojis: ___ ___ ___ ___ ___). We've got the attention of the higher-ups, let's show them why we're the best team in all of Ada Space Labs!</p>
