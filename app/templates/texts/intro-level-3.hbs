<h3>Level 3:</h3>
<p>Awesome job! I just got word from the Chief Scientist and she is thrilled with how well things have been progressing since you joined the team. She's greenlit the next stage of our proposal, and we're about to receive shipment of an even more unusual Emojivator. Unlike the previous Emojivators we've examined, this one appears to work by *consuming* emoji tablets. That is, sometimes when we have put in a sequence of emoji tablets, we get the same sequence in return, with one or more of the tablets missing. We still haven't figured out what the purpose could be for that behavior -- but we're pretty sure that is what's happening. Everyone here is excited to find out what you can learn about this new Emojivator, and what it might mean for the other Emojivators we've found...</p>
