<h3>Level 4:</h3>
<p>These results are... impressive. I would never have guessed that the Emojivators had such complex behaviors governing their output. We've had our linguistics team working through your report all weekend, and I believe there are some implications to this data that extend beyond even our wildest theories about the Emojivators' origins. More on that later, but I did want to inform you of another interesting development over the weekend. One of our lab technicians who was operating the Emojivator on behalf of the linguistics team got some unexpected output.</p>
<p>He likely provided the incorrect input emojis by accident, but what is remarkable is actually the output he received... or rather, didn't. The weirdest thing is, the Emojivator never actually provided any output, despite processing all of the emojis he provided. Unfortunately in his rush to report this bizarre behavior to the team, he misplaced the notes he had been given on what inputs to use. While we track that information down, I'd really appreciate it if you could put your mind to working out what sequence of emojis he might have provided by accident.</p>
