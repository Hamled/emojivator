<p>Welcome to Ada Space Labs, ____! As our most recent addition to the Anomalous Materials and Artifacts division, you've been assigned the role of Research Assistant.</p>
<p>You could not have joined us at a more opportune time, we've just been granted direct authority over a series of unidentified, potentially extraterrestrial objects for further investigation. Several of these objects appear to be capable some kind of language translation, however we have yet to determine what language(s) are involved.</p>
<p>So your first task will be to help us to better understand the inner workings of these machines -- which we've nicknamed "Emojivators" -- and whether they can be used to further our scientific pursuits. Presently all we know is that the language these Emojivators use is entirely pictographic, consisting of simple illustrations for individual objects and creatures. The excavation team which uncovered the Emojivators also found several such illustrations (emojis) on small tablets in the same general area.</p>
<p>In our previous testing, when we provided a few of these emoji tablets into what appears to be the machine's "intake" area, we were surprised to discover that the machine responded by producing a set of emoji tablets on the other end (which we've labeled the "output" area). Sometimes those emojis were the same as what we placed into the intake, but sometimes the machine produced entirely new emojis we had never seen before.</p>
<p>Somehow these Emojivators are capable of constructing new emoji tablets, and our top scientists now believe that finding these new emojis -- and learning the mechanisms that produce them -- will be critical to developing our knowledge of these artifacts and the language they "speak". In order to do that, we're giving you complete control over one of our Emojivator machines, along with a set of emoji tablets to use as inputs.</p>
<p>Some of the scientists have identified interesting sequences of emoji tablets that they would like to see your Emojivator produce. We would like you to figure out which emoji tablets can be used as inputs in order to attain the desired output. Some of this work will by necessity be trial an error... but we're pretty sure that the machine has a consistent and repeatable logic for producing its output. If you can deduce some of the rules of that logic through trial an error, it should help a great deal in discovering the required inputs.</p>
