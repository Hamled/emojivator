<p>Excellent work with that first Emojivator! Our research team is working to integrate your findings into our data sets for the Emojivator project. In the mean time, we would like to see what you can discover for the next Emojivator. This machine is a bit larger than the first one you've worked on, and it appears to accept all of the output emojis from the first Emojivator. One unusual property we've noticed from this Emojivator, is that it sometimes produces not just different emojis, but also MORE emojis in its output than we provided as our input. We're not yet sure how it constructs these new tablets and we need you to find as many of them as possible.</p>
